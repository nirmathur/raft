# Recursive Agent for Formal Trust (RAFT)

RAFT is a recursive agent system with formal trust guarantees, featuring spectral radius guards, proof gates, and operator escape hatches.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Environment Variables

#### Operator API Configuration
- `OPERATOR_TOKEN`: Bearer token for operator API authentication (default: "devtoken")
- `ENERGY_GUARD_ENABLED`: Enable/disable energy monitoring (default: "true", set to "false" to disable)

### Ports

The system uses the following ports:

| Service | Port | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| PostgreSQL | 5432 | Database |
| Redis | 6379 | Cache and pub/sub |
| ChromaDB | 8000 | Vector database |
| Ollama | 11434 | LLM inference |
| Operator API | 8001 | Control interface |

### Running with Docker

```bash
cd docker
docker-compose up -d
```

The operator API will be available at `http://localhost:8001` with the token set in the environment.

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run tests
poetry run pytest

# Run governor
poetry run python -m agent.core.governor
```
