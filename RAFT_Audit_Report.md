# RAFT Engine Audit Report
*Senior Engineering Assessment - January 2025*

## Executive Summary

The Core RAFT Engine implements a provably-safe, self-auditing agentic OS with three foundational pillars: **Z3-based proof gates** that verify all self-modifications against safety invariants, an **energy guard** that tracks computational resource consumption with apoptosis triggers, and a **spectral-radius governor** that prevents unstable system dynamics through eigenvalue monitoring. Current implementation is at Beta maturity with functional Z3 verification, basic spectral monitoring, and operator controls, but lacks production-ready energy measurement, real-time drift detection, and comprehensive audit trails required by charter compliance.

## Audit Findings

### ‚úÖ **Implemented Features**

**Z3 Proof Gates (Charter xÀ£-22a, xÀ£-9, xÀ£-30)**
- Functional Z3-based SMT verification with Redis caching (24h TTL)
- Diff-to-SMT translation with forbidden pattern detection
- Proof cache keyed on `sha256(diff):sha256(charter)` per charter xÀ£-23

**Spectral Governor (Charter xÀ£-17)**
- Eigenvalue-based stability monitoring with œÅ(J) < 0.9 threshold
- Automatic rollback on spectral radius breach
- Real-time spectral radius calculation using NumPy

**Operator Sovereignty (Charter xÀ£-11, xÀ£-11b)**
- FastAPI-based admin endpoints (`/pause`, `/kill`, `/state`)
- Bearer token authentication for operator controls
- Watchdog thread monitoring with daemon mode

**Event Logging (Charter xÀ£-1, xÀ£-3, xÀ£-12)**
- Structured JSONL event logging with timestamps
- Append-only failure recording before state overwrites
- Event sourcing architecture for audit trails

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing/Incomplete Features**

**Energy Governance (Charter xÀ£-29, xÀ£-71)**
- Energy measurement is placeholder-only (lines 28-34 in `energy_guard.py`)
- No actual kWh tracking or cost monitoring
- Missing apoptosis trigger for 2√óHERMES-Core baseline breach

**Multi-Cycle Monitoring (Charter xÀ£-19, xÀ£-24, xÀ£-25)**
- Drift sensors not implemented (governor comment line 13)
- No KL divergence or hidden-state variance tracking
- Missing novelty score monitoring for policy embeddings

**Real Model Integration**
- Fake Jacobian matrices (line 50-52 in `governor.py`)
- Placeholder MAC estimates (line 85 in `governor.py`)
- No actual neural network parameter monitoring

**Charter Compliance Automation**
- Charter clause parsing incomplete (line 83 in `diff_builder.py`)
- No automated CI compliance gates
- Missing Minisign signature chain verification

## Risks & Mitigations

### üî¥ **Risk 1: Energy Runaway (High Severity)**
**Gap:** No actual energy measurement enables unlimited resource consumption
**Impact:** System could exceed operational budgets, violate charter xÀ£-29
**Mitigation:** 
- Implement hardware energy monitoring via RAPL/NVML APIs
- Add configurable energy budgets with hard stops
- Create energy dashboard for operator oversight
- **Timeline:** 5 days

### üü° **Risk 2: Drift Blindness (Medium Severity)**  
**Gap:** Missing multi-cycle behavioral drift detection
**Impact:** Gradual system degradation undetected, charter xÀ£-19 violation
**Mitigation:**
- Implement KL divergence tracking between policy states
- Add statistical process control for hidden state variance
- Create automated drift alerts with rollback triggers
- **Timeline:** 8 days

### üü° **Risk 3: Incomplete Proof Coverage (Medium Severity)**
**Gap:** SMT verification limited to forbidden patterns, not full safety proofs
**Impact:** Subtle safety violations may pass Z3 gates
**Mitigation:**
- Expand SMT formula generation to include goal preservation
- Add semantic analysis of code changes beyond pattern matching
- Implement formal verification of charter clause compliance
- **Timeline:** 12 days

## Refined Roadmap Table

| Milestone | Description | Effort (Days) | Dependencies |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| **M1: Energy Monitoring** | Implement hardware energy measurement with RAPL/NVML integration and apoptosis triggers | 5 | Hardware access, RAPL drivers |
| **M2: Drift Detection** | Add KL divergence tracking, hidden-state variance monitoring, and novelty scoring | 8 | M1 (energy baseline), statistical libraries |
| **M3: Enhanced Proof Gates** | Expand SMT verification beyond pattern matching to semantic safety analysis | 12 | Z3 expertise, formal methods |
| **M4: CI Compliance Gates** | Automate charter compliance checking with Minisign signature chains | 6 | CI/CD pipeline, signing infrastructure |
| **M5: Production Hardening** | Add comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and operator dashboards | 10 | M1-M4, monitoring infrastructure |

**Critical Path:** M1 ‚Üí M2 ‚Üí M5 (energy monitoring enables drift baselines, both required for production)
**Total Estimated Effort:** 41 days
**Recommended Parallel Tracks:** M3 and M4 can proceed independently of M1-M2 sequence
